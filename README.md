# Medical Image Data Engineering & ML Pipeline for Capsule Endoscopy

## Overview
This repository documents a data engineering and machine learning pipeline developed during my
Machine Learning Research Internship at National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan.
The project focuses on preprocessing and analyzing capsule endoscopy images for the classification
of intestinal disorders.

## Data Engineering Pipeline
- Collected and organized large-scale medical image datasets (WLI and enhanced imaging formats)
- Performed data cleaning, resizing, normalization, and augmentation
- Applied class balancing techniques to address dataset bias
- Designed reproducible train/validation/test splits

## Machine Learning Workflow
- Implemented CNN-based feature extraction for medical images
- Trained and evaluated multiple ML/DL models for disorder classification
- Compared performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Conducted comparative analysis between imaging modalities

## Tools & Technologies
Python, NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn

## Key Outcome
The pipeline enabled fair and reproducible evaluation of medical imaging models and contributed
to validating enhanced imaging techniques over standard white-light imaging.

## Note
Due to data privacy and institutional policies, raw datasets and full experimental code are not
publicly shared. This repository serves as a technical and architectural showcase of the workflow.
